## executive summary

This report presents the high level results and recommended actions from an exploratory analysis of the titanic data. The analysis looked at passenger demographics, cabin and embarkation information, family status, and survival outcomes to identify factors associated with survival.

## key findings

- sex and passenger class are the strongest predictors of survival. female passengers and those in higher classes had higher survival rates.
- age shows a clear relationship with outcomes. younger passengers generally had a higher chance of survival than older passengers.
- cabin information is incomplete. the large amount of missing values means deck level conclusions should be treated with caution.
- embarkation patterns reveal socioeconomic sorting. passengers who boarded at queenstown were predominantly third class.

## recommendations

1. run a controlled model. fit a logistic regression that includes age, sex, passenger class, and family size to quantify effect sizes and uncertainty.
2. impute missing ages thoughtfully. use group medians by extracted title (for example mr, mrs, miss) and compare model results before and after imputation.
3. engineer features that add signal. extract titles from names, and create a family size feature from sibsp and parch to capture social grouping effects.
4. treat missing cabin as information. create a has_cabin flag and evaluate whether missingness itself predicts outcome before parsing deck letters.
5. document limitations. attach a short appendix that explains missing data, potential biases, and the observational nature of the results.

## next steps

- implement the logistic model and report coefficients, odds ratios, and confidence intervals for the main predictors.
- compare model performance with and without age imputation and with different feature sets.
- prepare a short slide deck summarizing findings and recommended actions for stakeholders.

## how to reproduce the analysis

open the notebook `titanic_project.ipynb` in jupyter or in your preferred editor and run the cells in order to regenerate figures and tables. to automate execution, use nbconvert in a python environment that includes pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and numpy.

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /Users/nemo/Desktop/Python_Data_Project/titanic_project.ipynb --output /Users/nemo/Desktop/Python_Data_Project/titanic_project_executed.ipynb
```

## limitations

- missing values in `age` and `cabin` can bias results if handled naively. any inference should report how missing data were addressed.
- the analysis is observational and shows associations, not causation. historical context is important for interpretation.

## appendix and contact

for a deeper technical appendix, including code snippets, model diagnostics, and data quality checks, request a follow up and we will prepare the materials. if you want a slide deck or a pdf summary, tell me the audience and the preferred level of technical detail and I will prepare it.
